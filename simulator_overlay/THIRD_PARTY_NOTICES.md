# Third-party materials

This directory is a source overlay applied to the pinned upstream checkout,
not a redistribution of its compiled robot or stock NVIDIA assets. The
upstream-relative paths below describe that complete checkout. YUBI hardware
source is available in the [pinned upstream repository](https://github.com/StevenLiudw/dual-franka-yubi-isaac-sim/tree/29652dc4e93903514b292b24988fd1a893b10e21/yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/yubi)
and [Toyota's v2.0.0 source](https://github.com/Toyota/yubi-hw/tree/v2.0.0).
Its license is retained as [YUBI_CERN-OHL-W-2.0.txt](YUBI_CERN-OHL-W-2.0.txt).

The repository's MIT license covers the original simulator code and project
documentation. It does not relicense the CAD, derived YUBI geometry, NVIDIA
robot assets, Isaac Sim, or any other third-party material.

## Toyota YUBI hardware

The source YUBI hardware is Copyright 2026 Toyota Motor Corporation and
licensed under CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2, Weakly Reciprocal
(CERN-OHL-W-2.0). The original [v2.0.0 source](https://github.com/Toyota/yubi-hw/tree/v2.0.0)
and [v1.1.2 source](https://github.com/Toyota/yubi-hw/tree/v1.1.2) are preserved
in `yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/yubi/source_v2.0.0/` and
`yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/yubi/source_v1.1.2/` with their respective `LICENSE`
files. `yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/yubi/source_manifest.json` records the source URLs, revisions,
and SHA-256 hashes.

**Modification notice, 2026-09-27:** For this simulator, the v2.0.0 motorized
assembly STEP was separated into fixed, left-jaw, and right-jaw meshes; the
v1.1.2 `FR_FLANGE.stl` was converted to the simulator's metric mounting frame.
The resulting STL files in `yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/yubi/meshes/` and YUBI geometry authored in
`yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/franka_yubi_panda.usdc` are modified material derived from the Toyota
source. The geometry was transformed for Isaac Sim joint articulation and
flange alignment. `yubi_isaac_sim_env/tools/export_yubi_assembly.py` and the manifests in
`yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/yubi/` document the transformations. These Toyota-derived parts remain
subject to CERN-OHL-W-2.0; their complete source is included above.

## NVIDIA Isaac Sim Franka Panda asset

This public repository does **not** distribute the stock `franka_panda` USD
directory or Isaac Sim binaries. `yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/franka_yubi_panda.usdc` references a
stock Franka Panda asset at `yubi_isaac_sim_env/assets/franka_panda/franka_panda.usd`; it does not
embed the stock robot meshes. Each user must obtain Isaac Sim assets under
their applicable NVIDIA terms and provision the Panda directory locally with
`scripts/provision_franka.py`. The destination is excluded by `.gitignore`.
